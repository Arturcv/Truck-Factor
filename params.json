{"name":"Truck-Factor","tagline":"What is the Truck-Factor of Popular GitHub Applications?","body":"The **Truck Factor** designates the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated.  The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) defines that it is a \"measurement of the concentration of information in individual team members. A high truck factor means that many individuals know enough to carry on and the project could still succeed even in very adverse events.\" The term is also known by bus factor/number.\r\n\r\nWe calculate the Truck Factor for 133 popular GitHub applications, in  six languages: JavaScript (22 systems), Python (22 systems), Ruby (33 systems) , C/C++ (18 systems), Java (21 systems), and PHP (17 systems). \r\n\r\nWe define an _author_ as a developer able to command the implementation of a file. To infer the authors of a file we used the Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) metric, proposed by Thomas Fritz et al. in this [paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1806856). The degree-of-authorship of a developer _d_ in a file _f_ depends on three factors: first authorship (FA), number of deliveries (DL), and number of acceptances (AC). We consider only normalized DOA values. For a file _f_, the normalized DOA ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is granted to the developer with the highest absolute DOA. We consider that a developer _d_ is an author of a file _f_ if its normalized DOA is greater than 0.75.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the truck factor, we use a greedy heuristic: we consecutively remove the author with more authored files in a system, until more than 50% of the system's files are orphans (i.e., without author). \r\n\r\nThis list presents the Truck Factors (TF) we calculated:\r\n\r\n* **TF = 1**: activeadmin/activeadmin, alexreisner/geocoder, atom/atom-shell, bjorn/tiled,\r\nbumptech/glide, caskroom/homebrew-cask, celery/celery, celluloid/celluloid,\r\nclojure/clojure, codemirror/CodeMirror, dropwizard/dropwizard, dropwizard/metrics, elasticsearch/logstash, erikhuda/thor, Eugeny/ajenti, getsentry/sentry, github/android, gruntjs/grunt, jadejs/jade, janl/mustache.js, jnicklas/capybara, jrburke/requirejs, justinfrench/formtastic, kivy/kivy, koush/ion,\r\nkriswallsmith/assetic, Leaflet/Leaflet, less/less.js, mailpile/Mailpile, mbostock/d3,\r\nmeskyanichi/backup, mitchellh/vagrant, mitsuhiko/flask, mongoid/mongoid,\r\nnate-parrott/Flashlight, netty/netty, nicolasgramlich/AndEngine, \r\nomab/django-social-auth, openframeworks/openFrameworks, paulasmuth/fnordmetric, phacility/phabricator, plataformatec/devise\r\npowerline/powerline, puphpet/puphpet, pydata/pandas, ratchetphp/Ratchet,\r\nReactiveX/RxJava, sampsyo/beets, sandstorm-io/capnproto, sass/sass,\r\nsebastianbergmann/phpunit, sferik/twitter, silexphp/Silex, sparklemotion/nokogiri,\r\nsstephenson/sprockets, strongloop/express, substack/node-browserify,\r\nThinkUpLLC/ThinkUp, thoughtbot/factory_girl, thoughtbot/paperclip, wp-cli/wp-cli\r\n\r\n* **TF = 2**: ajaxorg/ace, ansible/ansible, apache/cassandra, bbatsov/rubocop, bundler/bundler\r\nbup/bup, composer/composer, cucumber/cucumber, divio/django-cms\r\ndriftyco/ionic, drupal/drupal, elasticsearch/elasticsearch, excilys/androidannotations, facebook/osquery, facebook/presto, FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer, github/linguist, haml/haml, Itseez/opencv, jashkenas/backbone, jekyll/jekyll, JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit, jquery/jquery-ui\r\nlibgdx/libgdx, moment/moment, mozilla/pdf.js, mrdoob/three.js, prawnpdf/prawn\r\nRespect/Validation, rg3/youtube-dl, SFTtech/openage, \r\nspring-projects/spring-framework, thinkaurelius/titan, thumbor/thumbor\r\nWordPress/WordPress, xetorthio/jedis, yiisoft/yii2\r\n\r\n* **TF = 3**: bitcoin/bitcoin, boto/boto, BVLC/caffe, gradle/gradle, ipython/ipython\r\njquery/jquery, meteor/meteor, Shopify/active_merchant, spotify/luigi\r\n\r\n* **TF = 4**: chef/chef, cocos2d/cocos2d-x, emberjs/ember.js, iojs/io.js, ruby/ruby\r\n\t\r\n* **TF = 5**: diaspora/diaspora, django/django, joomla/joomla-cms, resque/resque, TryGhost/Ghost\r\n\r\n* **TF = 6**: puppetlabs/puppet, scikit-learn/scikit-learn\r\n\r\n* **TF = 7**: rails/rails\r\n\r\n* **TF = 8**: git/git ,JetBrains/intellij-community, Seldaek/monolog, v8/v8, webscalesql/webscalesql-5.6\r\n\r\n* **TF = 9**: saltstack/salt\r\n\r\n* **TF = 10**: fog/fog\r\n\r\n* **TF = 11**: odoo/odoo, php/php-src\r\n\r\n* **TF = 12**: android/platform_frameworks_base\r\n\r\n* **TF = 21**: fzaninotto/Faker\r\n\r\n* **TF = 90**: torvalds/linux\r\n\r\n* **TF = 159**: Homebrew/homebrew\r\n\r\nOur results are summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n* Most systems have a small truck factor: \r\n * 61 systems have TF=1 (46%), including systems like mbostock/d3, and clojure/clojure.\r\n * 37 systems have TF=2 (28%), including systems like cucumber/cucumber, mrdoob/three.js, mozilla/pdf.js, spring-projects/spring-framework.\r\n\r\n* The two systems with the highest Truck Factor are torvalds/linux (TF = 90) and Homebrew/homebrew (TF = 159).  \r\n","google":"UA-8249107-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
