{"name":"Truck-factor","tagline":"Calculating the Truck-Fator of Popular GitHub Applications","body":"The truck (or bus) factor designates the minimal number of developers that would have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated.  The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) defines that it \"is a measurement of the concentration of information in individual team members. A high bus factor means that many individuals know enough to carry on and the project could still succeed even in very adverse events.\"\r\n\r\nWe calculated the Truck Nimber for 133 popular GitHub applications. \r\n\r\nWe define an _author_ as a developer able to influence or command the implementation of a file. To infer the authors of a file we used the Degree-of-Authorship (DOA) metric, proposed by Thomas Fritz et al. in this [paper](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1806856). According to this metric, the degree of authorship of a developer d in a file f depends on three factors: first authorship (FA), number of deliveries (DL), and number of acceptances (AC).We consider only normalized DOA values. For a file _f_, the normalized DOA ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 is granted to the developer with the highest absolute DOA. We consider that a developer _d_ is an author of a file _f_ if its normalized DOA is greater than 0.75.\r\n\r\nTo calculate the truck factor, we used a greedy algorithm: we consecutively removed the author with more authored files in a system, until more than 50% of the system's files become orphan (i.e., without author). Therefore, we consinder that a system would be in trouble if more than 50% of its files become orphan.\r\n\r\nThe following list presents the Truck Numbers we calculated:\r\n\r\n* TF = 1: activeadmin/activeadmin, alexreisner/geocoder, atom/atom-shell, bjorn/tiled,\r\nbumptech/glide, caskroom/homebrew-cask, celery/celery, celluloid/celluloid,\r\nclojure/clojure, codemirror/CodeMirror, dropwizard/dropwizard, dropwizard/metrics, elasticsearch/logstash, erikhuda/thor, Eugeny/ajenti, getsentry/sentry, github/android, gruntjs/grunt, jadejs/jade, janl/mustache.js, jnicklas/capybara, jrburke/requirejs, justinfrench/formtastic, kivy/kivy, koush/ion,\r\nkriswallsmith/assetic, Leaflet/Leaflet, less/less.js, mailpile/Mailpile, mbostock/d3,\r\nmeskyanichi/backup, mitchellh/vagrant, mitsuhiko/flask, mongoid/mongoid,\r\nnate-parrott/Flashlight, netty/netty, nicolasgramlich/AndEngine, \r\nomab/django-social-auth, openframeworks/openFrameworks, paulasmuth/fnordmetric, phacility/phabricator, plataformatec/devise\r\npowerline/powerline, puphpet/puphpet, pydata/pandas, ratchetphp/Ratchet,\r\nReactiveX/RxJava, sampsyo/beets, sandstorm-io/capnproto, sass/sass,\r\nsebastianbergmann/phpunit, sferik/twitter, silexphp/Silex, sparklemotion/nokogiri,\r\nsstephenson/sprockets, strongloop/express, substack/node-browserify,\r\nThinkUpLLC/ThinkUp, thoughtbot/factory_girl, thoughtbot/paperclip, wp-cli/wp-cli\r\n\r\n* TF = 2: ajaxorg/ace, ansible/ansible, apache/cassandra, bbatsov/rubocop, bundler/bundler\r\nbup/bup, composer/composer, cucumber/cucumber, divio/django-cms\r\ndriftyco/ionic, drupal/drupal, elasticsearch/elasticsearch, excilys/androidannotations, facebook/osquery, facebook/presto, FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer, github/linguist, haml/haml, Itseez/opencv, jashkenas/backbone, jekyll/jekyll, JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit, jquery/jquery-ui\r\nlibgdx/libgdx, moment/moment, mozilla/pdf.js, mrdoob/three.js, prawnpdf/prawn\r\nRespect/Validation, rg3/youtube-dl, SFTtech/openage, \r\nspring-projects/spring-framework, thinkaurelius/titan, thumbor/thumbor\r\nWordPress/WordPress, xetorthio/jedis, yiisoft/yii2\r\n\r\n* TF = 3: bitcoin/bitcoin, boto/boto, BVLC/caffe, gradle/gradle, ipython/ipython\r\njquery/jquery, meteor/meteor, Shopify/active_merchant, spotify/luigi\r\n\r\n* TF = 4:chef/chef, cocos2d/cocos2d-x, emberjs/ember.js, iojs/io.js, ruby/ruby\r\n\t\r\n* TF = x: diaspora/diaspora, django/django, joomla/joomla-cms, resque/resque, TryGhost/Ghost\r\n\r\n* TF = x: puppetlabs/puppet, scikit-learn/scikit-learn\r\n\r\n* TF = x: rails/rails\r\n\r\n* TF = x: git/git ,JetBrains/intellij-community, Seldaek/monolog, v8/v8, webscalesql/webscalesql-5.6\r\n\r\n* TF = x: saltstack/salt\r\n\r\n* TF = x: fog/fog\r\n\r\n* TF = x: odoo/odoo, php/php-src\r\n\r\n* TF = x: android/platform_frameworks_base\r\n\r\n* TF = x: fzaninotto/Faker\r\n\r\n* TF = x: torvalds/linux\r\n\r\n* TF = x: Homebrew/homebrew","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
